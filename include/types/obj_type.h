/* The principle is to be able to change the type of a pointer by pointing
 * it directly to an object type. The object type indicates the format of the
 * structure holing the type, and this is used to retrieve the pointer to the
 * beginning of the structure. Doing so saves us from having to maintain both
 * a pointer and a type for elements such as connections which can point to
 * various types of objects.
